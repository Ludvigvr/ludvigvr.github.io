						<h1>Ancestor worship</h1>
						<p>Vietnamese ancestor worship is
							characterized by a great reverence
							for forefathers and their lasting
							impact. It is influenced by both
							Confucian and Taoist principles of
							philosophy, emphasizing family unity
							and veneration of elders. Families
							usually maintain sacred altars
							devoted to ancestors and participate
							in holy rituals on special occasions.
						</p>

						<p>These ceremonies include burning of incense and reciting prayers, which symbolize a
							connection between worlds. Places designated to Đình's, such as the Đình, commemorate local
							heroes and ancestors, contributing to social cohesion. The spirits of ancestors are believed
							to influence daily life, and adhering to their guidance is essential. The practice of
							ancestor worship is still widespread, reflecting the significance of Vietnamese heritage and
							familial ties amidst societal changes.</p>

						<p>Visiting pagodas during Tet, the Lunar New Year, is a beloved tradition in Vietnam. People
							nationwide flock to pagodas to pray and seek blessings for the upcoming year, as they hold
							great significance during this time. Pagodas serve as places of worship and spiritual
							reflection, where individuals pay respects to the Buddha, seek guidance from spiritual
							figures, and honor their ancestors' protection and blessings. Upon arrival, visitors light
							incense, offer symbolic items, and engage in rituals like bowing and reciting prayers. This
							practice is not just spiritual but also social, as families and friends come together to pay
							respects and strengthen bonds. The annual pilgrimage embodies Vietnamese spirituality,
							cultural traditions, and the belief in prayers and blessings, reminding us of the importance

						<h1>God of Wealth Worship in business </h1>
						<p>In Vietnamese business culture, the god of wealth, known as "Ông Táo" or "Thần Tài," is held
							in high esteem for his reputed ability to grant wealth to those who seek his assistance.
							Businesspeople often display portraits or images of this celebrated deity during significant
							occasions, believing that his presence will bring them success and prosperity.
							To invoke the blessings of the god of wealth, entrepreneurs engage in a range of offerings
							and rituals like burning incense, reciting prayers, and making specific requests. These
							practices are believed to attract good luck and fortune, and connect businesspeople to the
							spiritual realm.
							During Tet, the Vietnamese Lunar New Year, businesses host elaborate festivities adorned
							with red and gold decorations. The color red symbolizes good luck and prosperity while gold
							represents wealth and abundance. By creating an environment steeped in these auspicious
							colors, businesses hope to attract positive energy and financial success throughout the
							upcoming year.

						</p>
						<p>The exchange of lucky red envelopes (li xi) is another captivating tradition associated with
							the god of wealth. These envelopes contain monetary gifts and are given during festive
							occasions, particularly during Tet. Gifting red envelopes is believed to bestow
							good fortune and blessings upon both the giver and the recipient, reflecting the Vietnamese
							belief in the interconnectedness of spirituality and material wealth.
							Overall, the veneration of the god of wealth in Vietnamese business culture reflects the
							profound belief of Vietnamese people in seeking divine intervention and guidance to achieve
							prosperity and financial success. The display of portraits, the performance of rituals, and
							the exchange of red envelopes all contribute to cultivating an environment that is
							spiritually charged and conducive to attracting wealth and good fortune in the realm of
							business.</p>
